      Understanding how ADHD diagnosis works, where to start, and how to navigate the process with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Getting diagnosed can be a rollercoaster – part relief, part frustration, part “finally, it all makes sense”.
But it’s also the start of getting the right help, building strategies, and understanding your brain in a way that finally feels fair.

Below are some useful starting points and common questions to help you make informed decisions.

      <h3>1) How do I start the ball rolling for a diagnosis?</h3>
      <p>If you think you might have ADHD, the first step is simply talking to your GP. Before your appointment, it really helps to fill in something called the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) – it’s a quick questionnaire that gives your doctor a clearer picture of your symptoms.
You can find it on the NHS website
 or via ADHD UK’s screening tools page
.

When you go in, explain that you’d like to be referred for an ADHD assessment. If your GP says no (or isn’t sure what to do), don’t panic – you can still use the Right to Choose route (explained further down this page).

Tip: it helps to take a few notes with you, or even write down a few examples of how ADHD-type traits show up in your daily life – memory issues, focus, emotional swings, organisation struggles, etc. The more specific you can be, the better.

    <div id="q2" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>2) What’s the difference between NHS and private assessments?</h3>
      <p>In terms of the actual assessment, there’s not a huge difference – the NICE guidelines (the rules clinicians follow) are the same for both. The main difference is time and cost.

NHS: Free, but the wait can be very long (we’re talking years in some areas).

Private: Much faster – sometimes within weeks – but can cost £1,000 or more, plus ongoing medication and review fees.

Private assessments can be brilliant if you can afford them, but it’s important to check that the provider follows NICE standards and is properly registered. ADHD UK has a great list of trusted clinics here: ADHD UK’s provider directory
.

    </div>

    <div id="q3" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>3) How long does the ADHD assessment process take?</h3>
      <p>It really depends on which path you take:

Local NHS services – often 2 to 7 years wait.

Right to Choose providers – usually 3 to 6 months.

Private – sometimes as little as a few weeks.

Once your referral is accepted, you’ll get a bunch of forms to fill out before your assessment call or appointment. After that, your clinician will prepare a full report and (hopefully!) confirm your diagnosis within a few days or weeks.

)</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q4" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>4) What’s involved in an ADHD assessment?</h3>
      <p>Every provider does things slightly differently, but here’s what most people can expect:

You’ll complete a set of forms about your medical history, mood, and everyday functioning. These often include:

General health questionnaires (blood pressure, medication, etc.)

Mental health forms (about mood, anxiety, energy levels)

Childhood behaviour questionnaires (ideally filled in by someone who knew you as a kid)

The DIVA-5 diagnostic tool – this is a detailed form that looks at ADHD symptoms from childhood through adulthood

An informant form, usually completed by your partner, friend, or family member

After you’ve submitted everything, you’ll have a one-to-one appointment (often on Zoom). It’s a friendly conversation with a trained clinician who’ll go through your answers, ask for examples, and assess how ADHD traits show up for you.

Some people are diagnosed during that call; others get their report later that week.

    <div id="q5" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>5) What is the Right to Choose pathway?</h3>
      <p>Right to Choose (RTC) is a legal right for NHS patients in England. It means you can choose your own provider for certain NHS services – including ADHD assessments – instead of waiting years through your local area’s system.

The key thing is: the provider must be NHS-contracted and follow NICE standards.
Once you’ve picked one, you fill in a Right to Choose referral form and give it to your GP. They’re legally obliged to process it.

ADHD UK explains the scheme brilliantly here:
👉 ADHD UK: Right to Choose Explained

    </div>

    <div id="q6" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>6) Can my GP refuse to refer me for an assessment?</h3>
      <p>In short – no.
Your GP might not be familiar with Right to Choose, but legally they can’t refuse if your chosen provider has an NHS contract.

That said, some areas have temporary funding pauses due to high demand. If your GP says this is the case, ask when referrals are expected to reopen or if they can suggest an alternative provider.

ADHD UK regularly updates which Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) are active, paused, or delayed – see this page
 for the latest.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q7" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>7) What should I prepare before my appointment?</h3>
      <p>Here’s what really helps:

Old school reports (they can highlight early traits).

Someone who’s known you since childhood – they might be asked to fill in a short form.

Real examples of how ADHD affects you (home, work, relationships).

Honesty – try not to say what you think they want to hear.

It’s not an exam, and there’s no “right answer”. The more yourself you can be, the more accurate your assessment will be.

    </div>

    <div id="q8" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>8) How does diagnosis differ for women and girls?</h3>
      <p>Women and girls are often diagnosed much later – or missed entirely – because ADHD can look different in them.
Instead of hyperactivity, it might show up as daydreaming, emotional overwhelm, or constant mental chatter.

Hormones can also play a big part. Many women notice ADHD symptoms intensify before their period (the luteal phase) or after pregnancy.

    </div>

    <div id="q9" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>9) What happens after receiving a diagnosis?</h3>
      <p>Once diagnosed, you’ll get:

A detailed report outlining your symptoms and experiences

A summary letter for work, school or university

Access to medication titration if you choose that route

Optional therapy or coaching (sometimes fundable through Access to Work)

If your GP agrees to take over your prescriptions, brilliant – that’s called shared care. If not, your provider can usually continue prescribing, often at NHS prices if they’re contracted properly.

    </div>

    <div id="q10" class="diagnosis-section">
      <h3>10) What if I’m told I don’t meet the criteria?</h3>
      <p>It can be really disheartening, but it doesn’t mean you imagined it or that your challenges aren’t real.
ADHD overlaps with other conditions like anxiety, autism, and depression, and sometimes clinicians focus more on those symptoms.

You can:

Ask for a second opinion or reassessment later.

Request support for the symptoms you do experience (focus, sleep, emotional regulation, etc.).

Keep a symptom diary – it’s really helpful for future appointments.

Whatever the outcome, understanding yourself better is a big win in itself.
